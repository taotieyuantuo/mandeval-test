# MandEval — standalone frontend

This folder contains the frontend. Its authoritative mandate data is
**`../vaccine_mandates.csv`**, at the repository root. Keep both when copying the
project. No Python server, database or API connection is required.

## Start

Use Node.js 20.19+ or 22+. Open a terminal in this folder:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal. If the requested port is busy, Vite
selects another available port. On Windows, the repository root contains
`Start-Local-Demo.bat` and `Stop-Local-Demo.bat`; run them from there. The stop
launcher targets this checkout's Vite processes, regardless of the local port.
Ctrl+C in the startup terminal also stops the app.

## Data and search

Edit the root `vaccine_mandates.csv` to change mandate data. Keep the header names,
unique IDs and tab delimiter. The frontend fetches the file once per page load;
search and policy details share the loaded records. Development changes to the
root file reload the page automatically. A failed load displays an error instead
of silently substituting data.

To link a booster to an original mandate, set the original's `booster_id` to the
booster row's `id`. Its timeline segment overlays the original row. Hover cards
keep concise phase/date summaries, with a linked booster summary
below the original. The information panel keeps the original field order and
compact layout, with the complete booster record below the original. Both use
`(ID:123) Policy Name` headings.

Name and policy-target fuzzy searches update the displayed results as you type.
Each query matches its own field; when both are filled, a record must match both.
Search covers records in the selected jurisdictions and mandate types, including
boosters. These filters remain adjustable while searching. Visibility limits do
not hide matching records. The results list includes every match in this scope.
On the timeline, a matching booster overlays its original when that original
also matches; otherwise it appears as its own search-result row from enforcement
to removal. Each Clear button clears only the adjacent field. Once both fields
are empty, the previous visibility and date-window settings return while the
current jurisdiction and type selections remain active.
The category filter and separate experimental search are removed.

Optional `visibility_level` values (integers 1–6) override automatic levels.
If omitted, duration thresholds are used: >=365 days → 1, >=270 → 2,
>=180 → 3, >=90 → 4, >=30 → 5, shorter/unknown → 6.
Missing `duration_days` values are calculated from effective/enforcement to removal.
These levels control display density, not policy importance.

Optional `ongoing` accepts true/false or 1/0. If omitted, a missing removal date
means ongoing; a supplied removal date means ended. The tail toggle adds a fade
and arrow without changing the recorded dates. It is disabled when the dataset
has no ongoing mandates. Booster rows follow the same rule and can extend beyond
the original mandate's removal date.

## Validate and build

```sh
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Publish the contents of `dist/` to a static web host. The build copies the current
root CSV into `dist/vaccine_mandates.csv`; the browser fetches this separate asset
at runtime. Publish that CSV along with the other build files. For data-only
updates, replace the deployed CSV and reload the page, or rebuild from the updated
root CSV and redeploy. Relative asset paths support deployment in a subdirectory.
Use an HTTP server rather than opening the generated HTML directly.
